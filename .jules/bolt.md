## 2024-05-24 - Optimizing Compose Recomposition in Lists
**Learning:** Passing large, frequently changing data objects (like `Conversation` which updates on every token) to list items (`ChatMessage`) causes massive unnecessary recomposition. Even if `LazyColumn` is used, visible items recompose because the data object identity changes. This also triggers expensive O(N) calculations inside every item (e.g. `conversation.currentMessages.indexOf(message)`).
**Action:** Pass only primitive/stable data (e.g., `previousRole`, `isLast`) to list items. Derive necessary context in the parent composable during the iteration loop. For callbacks depending on changing state, use `rememberUpdatedState` to create stable lambdas to prevent recreating them on every parent recomposition.
